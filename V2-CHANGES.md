# Portfolio V2 - 2025 Redesign

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
Modern, cyber-aesthetic dark theme that bridges software engineering and cybersecurity expertise.

## ✨ What's New

### Visual & Design
- **Dark Cyber Theme**: Complete redesign with darker palette (#0a0e27 bg) and purple accents (#5B5F97)
- **Terminal-Inspired Elements**: Command prompts, monospace fonts, blinking cursors
- **Glassmorphism Cards**: Modern card designs with subtle glows and borders
- **Enhanced Animations**: Smooth scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and micro-interactions

### Content Updates

#### Hero Section
- Added terminal `$ whoami` prompt with typewriter animation
- Dual role positioning: "Software Engineer → Cybersecurity Specialist"
- Tagline emphasizing both domains
- Animated "Available for hire" badge with pulsing indicator

#### Tech Stack (formerly Services)
- Reorganized into 4 categories: Development, Security, DevOps & Cloud, Enterprise
- Interactive skill tags that highlight on hover
- Visual icons for each category
- Clear display of both SWE and cybersecurity skills

#### About Section ("The Journey")
- Story-driven narrative with 3 sections:
  - 🚀 The Origin (5+ years SWE experience)
  - 🔐 The Pivot (transition to cybersecurity)
  - 💡 The Value (unique dual expertise)
- More compelling, punchy copy
- Emphasizes unique value proposition

#### NEW: Currently Section
- Real-time status showing what you're actively working on
- 3 categories: Learning, Practicing, Building
- Status bar with education, location, availability
- Terminal-themed design with `./currently.sh` header

### Technical Improvements
- Maintained scroll-triggered animations
- Responsive grid layouts
- Better font hierarchy (Inter/System fonts)
- Optimized component structure
- All existing features preserved

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # Development
npm run build  # Production build
```

## 📝 Customization Tips
1. Update content in component files (not hard-coded)
2. Adjust colors in CSS variables (`:root` in App.css)
3. Modify animations by tweaking `@keyframes` and delays
4. Add more skills/projects by updating data arrays

## 🎯 Target Audience
Designed to appeal to both:
- Software Engineering roles (Full-stack, Frontend, Backend)
- Cybersecurity positions (Pentesting, AppSec, Security Engineering)

The content emphasizes the unique value of understanding both perspectives.
